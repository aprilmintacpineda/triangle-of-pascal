# Pascal's triangle

## What

Pascal's triangle, named after **Blaise Pascal** is a triangle of hexagons (I'll call **cell**). Where the number of cells each row is `n + 1` where `n` is initially `1`. So `row 0` (which is the tip if the triangle) would have 1 cell in it, `row 1` would have 2 cells in it, `row 2` would have 3 cells in it, and so on.

These element would have numbers in them. The number would be the sum of the cell above to the left and the cell above to the right. If no cell is present on both sides (which would be the case for the cell on the tip of the triangle), then the value would be 1, if no cell is present on one side, the value of that side is presumed to be 0.
